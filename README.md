# Notification Service 

## Description

A modern microservice app for sending notifications via Email, SMS, and In-App messages â€” powered by Flask, Kafka, and MongoDB.

## Project Overview

This project is a scalable notification system designed to manage users and send notifications efficiently across multiple channels. It features:
  - A Flask REST API for user management and notification requests.
  - A Kafka message broker to handle asynchronous notification dispatching.
  - A Worker service that consumes Kafka messages and triggers notification delivery via email, SMS, or in-app.
  - MongoDB as the persistent store for user data and notifications.

## Functions

  - User Management: Create users with unique emails and phone numbers.
  - Notification Sending: Queue notifications (email, SMS, in-app) via Kafka.
  - Notification Processing: Worker consumes Kafka messages and dispatches notifications.
  - Retry Mechanism: Uses tenacity to retry failed notifications for better reliability.
  - Notification History: Retrieve past notifications per user from MongoDB.

## Technologies used

  - Backend: Python Flask 
  - Database: MongoDB 
  - Messaging: Apache Kafka 
  - Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8
  - MongoDB Atlas account / local MongoDB
  - Kafka setup (handled by Docker Compose in this project)

## Implementation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   https://github.com/ananyab1909/PepSales-Task.git
   ```

3. Enter into the directory
   ```
   cd PepSales-Task
   ```

5. Create environment config for Flask - Inside the root directory, create a .env file or edit your config.py file to include:
    ```
    MONGO_URI = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
    ```

7. Set up Docker and run the project
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

9. Access the API
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

11. Access the Kafka Consumer
     ```
     python worker.py
     ```
